Introduction
You will code a multi-processing and multi-threading program that finds if the given number is prime. 
The numbers to be searched will be given as command line arguments. You should use the simple trial division method. 
In this method, you will simply check if the given number(n) is divisible by any number in the range of (2 - n/2). 
For each number you need to create a process. 
Each process should create 4 threads to check a part of the range ((2-n/8), (n/8-n/4), (n/4-3n/8), (3n/8-n/2)). 
Threads will be responsible for checking divisibility of numbers in the assigned range. 
Upon completion of threads, processes should print if the number is a prime or not.
